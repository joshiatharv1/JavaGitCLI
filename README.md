üîß Configuration
The tool creates configuration files in your home directory:

~/.gitcli_history - Command history
~/.gitcli_aliases - Custom aliases
~/.gitcli/ - Configuration directory

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The tool is structured with several key components:

GitCLITool: Main application class handling command processing
CommandHistory: Manages persistent command history
AliasManager: Handles custom command aliases
GitManager: Wraps JGit operations for Git functionality
FuzzySearcher: Implements fuzzy search algorithm

üöÄ Advanced Features
Fuzzy Search Algorithm
The fuzzy search allows partial matching of commands:

Type comm to find commit commands
Search for br cr to find branch create commands

ProcessBuilder Integration
System commands are executed using ProcessBuilder:

Full process control with exit codes
Inherits IO for interactive commands
Cross-platform compatibility

JGit Integration
Direct Git repository manipulation:

No external Git dependencies
Pure Java implementation
Full Git feature support
